# CODE CHALLENGE TEST

About this repo

- This repo git logs will document the time that finished each problem based on the log commit messages.
- For the 2 react projects. I am using some of my own preset configurations with ShadCN and other css variables because I want to maintain a consistent design style that I have always been using and is used to.

Timeline:

- Start of Problem 1 at Aug 21st, 2025 on 14:00:00 (GMT +7)

- Start of Problem 2 at Aug 21st, 2025 on 14:22:00 (GMT +7)
- End of Problem 2 at Aug 21st, 2025 on 18:12:00 (GMT +7) - Might do some UI/UX improvements
